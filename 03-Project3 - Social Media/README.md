# Project 3 - Social Media

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/22

## Topics
 UIBarButtonItem, UIActivityViewController

## [Challenges](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/3/3/wrap-up):
1. Try adding the image name to the list of items that are shared. The activityItems parameter is an array, so you can add strings and other things freely. Note: Facebook wonâ€™t let you share text, but most other share options will.
2. Go back to project 1 and add a bar button item to the main view controller that recommends the app to other people.
3. Go back to project 2 and add a bar button item that shows their score when tapped.
